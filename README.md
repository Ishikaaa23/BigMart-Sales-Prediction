# **BigMart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning**
### Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the sales of products across different BigMart outlets using machine learning models. Sales prediction plays a vital role in retail businesses as it helps in inventory management, supply chain optimization, and decision-making for pricing and promotions. By analyzing historical sales data with product and store features, this project aims to build a reliable model that can estimate sales for each product-store combination.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the sales of items in BigMart outlets based on historical sales data and related features. Predicting accurate sales can help businesses plan better, reduce wastage, and improve profitability.

### Solution

The solution involves building machine learning models that learn from past sales data and capture relationships between product attributes and store information. Multiple models were tested, and the Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate results. The project follows a structured approach of preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and evaluation to generate precise sales predictions.

### Stages of the Project
#### 1. Data Collection and Loading

The dataset includes product-level attributes (e.g., item weight, item visibility, item type) and store-level details (e.g., outlet size, outlet type, location).

The data is loaded and inspected for missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to explore sales patterns.

Key trends include the effect of outlet size, product visibility, and item category on sales.

Correlation analysis helps identify significant factors influencing sales.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Missing weights and categorical entries are imputed using mean/median or mode strategies.

Encoding Categorical Variables: One-hot encoding and label encoding are applied to convert categorical data into numerical format.

Feature Engineering: Additional features like visibility ratio and combined item categories are created to enrich the dataset.

#### 4. Model Implementation

Multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) are trained on the dataset.

The Random Forest Regressor is chosen as the final model due to its robustness and ability to capture non-linear relationships.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

#### 5. Model Evaluation

Performance is measured using metrics such as:

RÂ² Score (to measure variance explained by the model)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

The Random Forest model achieved the best trade-off between accuracy and generalization.

#### 6. Saving and Reusing the Model

The trained Random Forest model is saved as rf_model.save for easy reusability without retraining.

Future predictions can be made by loading this model and feeding new input data.

### Technologies and Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Model: Random Forest Regressor

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

### Key Features of the Project

Handles missing data and categorical variables effectively.

Performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover trends.

Compares multiple machine learning models before final selection.

Saves the trained model for deployment or future predictions.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict retail sales using structured historical data. The Random Forest model provides reliable predictions by capturing both product-level and store-level factors affecting sales. These insights can help BigMart improve inventory planning, reduce losses, and maximize revenue.
